Minimalist project for trying out WPF bindings

## Why this project
Microsoft have created WPF. Undoubtedly, WPF is better than MFC. Even so, in terms of ease of use, it's garbage. Specifically, the way you bind things. Microsoft appears to confuse the act of _saying_ it's intuitive for actual elegance. The two are not the same.

At work, I have a piece of software that (mis)uses bindings. It's almost completely broken at this point, so I want to simplify it. This is my attempt at making a toy model of the login system.
